#JS Basics Mini Challenges
Goal:

Demonstrate basic programming and JavaScript skills and understanding of objectives. Build familiarity with JavaScript syntax and conventions of basic programming.

1. Assignment:
	* Create a script with two variables, each assigned to a number. Add them together and output the result to the console. Now do the same with two strings.
	* Create a multidimensional array related to a subject that interests you. Output two of the items in sub-arrays to the console.
	* Write a script that checks if a variable is less than 100. If it is, alert the user that their variable is less than 100. If it is not alert the user of what the value was and that it was greater than 100.
	* Declare a function that takes a name as an argument and tells the user what name they've entered. Try running it after it has been declared.
	* Declare a function that depending upon which virtual 'door' was entered tells the user they've received a different 'prize' in an alert. After declaring the function, try running it with different options. There must be at least 3 doors.

2. Grading criteria:
	* Code has a comment that notes which problem the code snippet is attempting to solve.
	* All solutions should explicitly fulfill the requirements noted in each problem. (e.g. problem 8 requires you to alert the user to what door they selected and what the prize is.)
	* Complete = Meets all grading criteria above.
	* Incomplete = Does not meet all grading criteria above. Needs improvement or missing submission.

 
# Scope/DOM/Event Mini Challenges - approx 4 hours
Goal:

Demonstrate understanding of DOM manipulation and events. Build familiarity with JS syntax.

1. Assignment:
    Complete and submit the following three exercises to go over JavaScript event binding:
		* Create an HTML page with two buttons that argue with each other. When one button is clicked, the text "I'm right" should be placed next to it. When the other button is clicked, the text is replaced with, "No, I'm right!"
		* Create an HTML page with a large element on the page that says "Don't hover over me" inside of it. When you hover over the element, send an alert to the user that says, "Hey, I told you not to hover over me!"
		* Create an HTML page with javascript that listens for a keypress.
		* When the user presses that key, the text of the H1 should show the value of the key they have pressed.
			* Example: If the user presses "J", the text inside the H1 should be "J".
		* Create an HTML page with a form. The form should include inputs for a username, email, and password as well as a submit button.
		* In a Javascript file, write code that does the following things:
			* checks that the password is 12345678
			* checks that the username contains at least one number
			* if anything is wrong, send an alert message saying "incorrect"
		* Your page should also include an H1 tag. If the information in the form is correct, have Javascript change the text in the H1.

2. Grading criteria:
	* Code has a comment that notes which problem the code snippet is attempting to solve.
	* All solutions should explicitly fulfill the requirements noted in each problem.
	* Complete = Meets all grading criteria above.
	* Incomplete = Does not meet all grading criteria above. Needs improvement or missing submission.
