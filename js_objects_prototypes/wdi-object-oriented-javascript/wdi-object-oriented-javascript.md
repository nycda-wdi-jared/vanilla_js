#[fit] Object<br>Oriented<br>JavaScript

---

# [fit] What is Procedural programming?

- Most of the programming we've been doing so far has been of the procedural kind, meaning step-by-step.

- In procedural programming, we simply write out exactly what our program is doing in a line-by-line manner

- This makes it difficult to reuse any code we've written

---

# [fit] What is Object Oriented programming?

- Rather than storing all of our code in one monolithic block, we organize it into objects

- These objects have attributes and methods, which is where all of the code we had written procedurally before ends up

- Rather than duplicating code every time we want some functionality, we instead call the object containing that functionality and invoke it

---

# [fit] What is Object Oriented programming?

- Objects have awareness of their own functionality, attributes, and methods

- Objects, in almost all cases, shouldn't have to refer to other objects within their methods and attributes, there should be as much "separation of concerns" as possible

- This will increase the ease of testing later on in the development process

---

# [fit] Creating your first JavaScript objects

JavaScript objects can be created in a few different ways, the simplest is the object literal:

````js
var myCar = {
  brand: "Prius",
  wheels: 4
}
// More on accessing attributes later on
// but here's a simple example
myCar.brand
>>"Prius"
````

---

# Exercise: Object Literals

- Try creating an object that represents something in the "real world" using the object literal notation (`Car`, `Person`, `User`)

- Create this object in the Chrome Developer Console or in a .js file that is loaded by a web page - then attempt to access the object in the developer console (type the variable name the object is stored in and press enter)

---

# Creating your first JavaScript objects - constructor function


You can also create an object through a function, known as a constructor:

````js
function Car(brand, wheels){
  this.brand = brand;
  this.wheels = wheels;
}

// creating a new instance of Car known as myCar
var myCar = new Car("toyota", 4);
````

This way, your objects have clearly defined attributes at instantiation (creation of an instance)

---

# Difference between objects and their instances

- When we refer to an object, we refer to the prototypal definition of it

- For example, a `Car` has a `brand` and `wheels`

- When we refer to an **instance** of an object, we're talking about a specific example of that object

- For example, an instance of the `Car` object has a `brand` of `"toyota"` and a `wheels` count of `4`

- Take a moment to process this, it is confusing

---

# Creating your first JavaScript objects - what is `this` ?


`this` simply refers to the object instance we're currently within, in this case we're referring to any instance of `Car`:

````js
function Car(brand, wheels){
  this.brand = brand;
  this.wheels = wheels;
}
````

---

# Creating your first JavaScript objects - instantiation review


Instantiation is the invocation of a new copy, or instance, of your object

````js
// defining what a car is
function Car(brand, wheels) {
  this.brand = brand;
  this.wheels = wheels;
}

// here we are instantiating a new instance of Car
var myCar = new Car("toyota", 4);

// we can create as many cars as we'd like!
var someOtherCar = new Car("maserati", 4);
````

---

# Exercise

- Create a new JavaScript file with a constructor function for an object of your choosing

- Instantiate two copies of that object without getting syntax errors

---

# [fit] Reading attributes, using methods

If you'd like to access the attributes or methods stored on your object, there are two different ways:

  - dot notation

  - square-bracket notation

---

# [fit] Reading attributes, using methods

Square bracket notation can be used to retrieve attributes whose names must be notated with quotes

````js
 var myCar = {
   brand: "Prius",
  "has-leather": false
 }

myCar["has-leather"]
 > false
````

---

## Reading attributes, using methods

Dot notation can be used for attribute names that can be notated without using quotes

````js
var myCar = {
  brand: "Prius",
  "has-leather": false
}

myCar.brand
> "Prius"
````

This is why you want to use simple names for attributes: the dot notation is far easier to use.

---

# Storing functions in object literals

Functions can also be easily stored on attributes of an object:

````js
var myCar = {
  brand: "Prius",
  friendlyBrand: function() {
    return "Your car's brand is " + this.brand;
  }
}
````

In this context, functions are known as methods. To access the method, just use () after the attribute name the function has:

````js
myCar.friendlyBrand()
>>"Your car's brand is Prius"
````

---

# Exercise

- Define an object using a constructor function that has at least one attribute and one method

- Instantiate a new instance of that object and try to access its attributes and methods

---

# Prototypes

- JavaScript is actually an entirely object oriented language.

- The only "basic" types in JavaScript, the simple types, are numbers, strings, booleans, null, and undefined

- Everything else is an object! And in fact, the above are actually also objects, they are simply immutable, meaning unchangeable

---

# Prototypes

- You can actually extend a JavaScript object, meaning add functionality through object attributes, fairly easily using its prototype

- This allows you to modify an object and its instances after they have been defined initially

- Don't forget that an object (`function Car`) is different from an object instance (`var myCar`)

---

# Prototypes: sample code

````js
function Car(brand, wheels) {
  this.brand = brand;
  this.wheels = wheels;
}

// add a method or attribute to the parent object
//by using the object's prototype
Car.prototype.friendlyBrand = function() {
  return "This car's brand is " + this.brand;
}

// define the new Car object
myCar = new Car("toyota", 4);

// now you can use that method in all instances of the object
myCar.friendlyBrand()
> "This car's brand is Toyota"
````

---

# Exercise

- Take the object you created in the last exercise and extend it using its prototype

- Add one more attribute and one more method to it

- Try to access these attributes and methods on both an already created instance and a brand new instance of the object

---

# Prototypal Objects

- We can also choose to have one object start out with another as its template

- For instance, an Admin object could extend from a User object but have a few different traits from the User object

---

# [fit] Prototypical Objects: Example Part 1

````js
// define the User constructor
function User(fname, lname, email){
  this.fname = fname;
  this.lname = lname;
  this.email = email;
}

// define the prototype methods
User.prototype.fullName = function() {
  return this.fname + " " + this.lname;
}
````

---

# [fit] Prototypical Objects: Example Part 2

````js
// define the Admin constructor
function Admin(fname, lname, email, admin){
  this.admin = admin

  // call User constructor
  User.call(this, fname, lname, email);
}

// admin now has all of the prototype methods of a User
Admin.prototype = Object.create(User.prototype);

// create a new admin
var newAdmin = new Admin("Orlando", "Caraballo", "o@email.com", true)

// because the Admin prototype was set to mirror
//  the User prototype we can now use the fullName() method on newAdmin
newAdmin.fullName()
````

---

# Exercise

Try creating an object, then extend another object from it. Some examples:

Animal -> Mammal

House -> Room
