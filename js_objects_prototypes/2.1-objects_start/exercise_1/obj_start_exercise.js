/*

• Try creating an object that represents something in the "real world" 
using the object literal notation (Car, Person, User)

• Create this object in the Chrome Developer Console or in a .js file 
that is loaded by a web page - then attempt to access the object in the 
developer console (type the variable name the object is stored in and press enter)

Bonus....Append some of the items to the DOM!!!
