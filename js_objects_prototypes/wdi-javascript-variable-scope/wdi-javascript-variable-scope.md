# [fit]JavaScript:<br>Variable<br>Scope

---

# Why learn about variable scope?

- In order to program JavaScript well, you'll need to understand how scope affects the value of variables

- Without this understanding, you won't be able to predict the outcome of your JavaScript

---

#[fit]Meet<br>the<br>Scopes

---

# Global Scope

A variable that can be accessed globally, within almost any part of your script

````js
var z = 1;

function printIt(){
  console.log(z); //Will return 1
}
````
---

# Local Scope

A variable that only pertains to the function you are currently in

````js
var z = 3;

function someF(z){
  console.log(z);
}
someF(10)
>>10

console.log(z);
>>3
````
---

# Local Scope
### Another example

````
var z = 3;

function someF(){
  var z = 20;
  console.log(z);
}
someF()
>>20

console.log(z);
>>3
````
---

# Exercise: Global vs. Local

Create a script that exemplifies global scope and local scope by logging a variable to the console.

---

# Block Scope

- Within any "block" of code, for instance an `if` statement, variables will mantain separate values than globally scoped versions of the variable

- This concept does not exist in JavaScript, **there is no block scope in JavaScript**

---

# Block Scope: Example

````js
var c = 10;

function hallo(){
  if(true){
    var c = 2;
  }
  console.log(c);
  // returns 2, not the global value 10
  // implication: variables don't have a
  // separate scope within a block
}
````
---

# Function Scope

An argument is only accessible within the function it gets declared in

````js
function haha(argument_uno){
  console.log(argument_uno);
}

haha("hello");
>>"hello"
console.log(argument_uno);
>>ReferenceError: argument_uno is not defined
````

# Exercise

Write a "cheat sheet" of runnable JavaScript code and comments that explain the concepts in this lecture so you have a reference
