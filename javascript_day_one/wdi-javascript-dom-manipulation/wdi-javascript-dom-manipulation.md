# [fit]JavaScript:<br>DOM<br>Manipulation

---

# What is DOM manipulation?

- Remember that DOM stands for **Document Object Model**

- The DOM is a representation of the HTML structure on the page that JavaScripts can interact with

- DOM manipulation simply means changing an element's text or inner html, or perhaps replacing it entirely

---

# The HTML `<form>` element

- The login, signup, and address forms you see online all share a common tag: `<form>`!

- Inside of `<form>` are several elements that make up forms: text input boxes, dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.

- Today, we'll just be using the text and password input elements, but in future classes you'll learn about all of them!

---

# `<form>` example

````html
<form action="/process" method="POST">
  <label for="username">Username</label>
  <input type="text" name="username" id="username">
  <label for="password">Password</label>
  <input type="password" name="password">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
````

Don't worry about action and method for now - also don't worry about submitting your form just yet

---

# [fit] Retrieve input from a form element

You can see what's inside of a form element fairly easily, using the .value attribute:

```html
<!-- Sample form input element -->
<input type="text" name="username" id="username">
```

````js
document.getElementById('username').value
// returns the value of the field
````
---

# Get the title of the form

- Imagine a `<form>` with an `<h1>` tag above it that has the form title

- We can use the attribute `.innerText` to retrieve the title inside the `<h1>` tag, or change it

````html
<h1 id="title">Enter your information</h1>
````

````js
heading = document.getElementById('title')
heading.innerText
>> "Enter your information"

// set name to Zach
var name = "Zach"

// Changes the text in the DOM
heading.innerText = "Enter " + name + "'s Information"

// inside of <h1> to say this instead
heading.innerText
>> "Enter Zach's Information"
````

---

# Change the content of a `<div>`

- Let's say that our `<h1>` lives inside of a `<div>`

- Using the `.innerHTML` attribute, we can change the innerHTML of the `<div>` entirely (see next slide)

---

# Change the content of a `<div>`

Before:

```html
<div id="main-section">
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</div>
```

JS:

```js
document.getElementById('main-section').innerHTML = "<h3>Hello World Smaller</h3>"
```

After:

```html
<div class="main-section">
  <h3>Hello World Smaller</h3>
</div>
```

---

# Dealing with Multiple Elements

- So far we have been selecting elements with unique id's

- What if we wanted to select by a class or tag?
  - document.getElementsByClassName('class-name-here')
  - document.getElementsByTagName('tag-name-here')

*Notice*: get__Elements__ByClassName vs. get__Element__ById

---

# Class & Tag Selectors

- getElementById: will return __ONE object__ or null.


- getElementByClassName or TagName: will return an __ARRAY of objects__.

```js
document.getElementById('title')
>> <h1>Hello World!</h1>

document.getElementsByTagName('p')
>> [<p>welcome to my site</p>, <p>buy my stuff</p>]
```

---

# Selecting From an Array

If you are using one of the multiple selectors, you can use [i] to select from the returned array.

```js
paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName('p')
>> [<p>welcome to my site</p>, <p>buy my stuff</p>]

paragraphs[0]
>> <p>welcome to my site</p>

paragraphs[1].innerText
>> 'buy my stuff'

```

---

# Selecting From an Array

````html
<h1>First Header</h1>
<h1>Second Header</h1>
<h1>Third Header</h1>
````

````js
var secondHeader = document.getElementsByClassName('h1')[1];
secondHeader.innerText = "New Text"

// the inner text of "secondHeader" is now set to "New Text"
secondHeader.innerText
>> 'New Text'
````

---

# Query Selectors

Some methods allow you to select an element or multiple elements by a selector or multiple selectors such as class, id or any other attribute name.

<br>

- `document.querySelector` - select one element that matches

- `document.querySelectorAll` - select all elements that match selector

---

# Query Selectors Example

```html
<p class="dog-paragraph" id="paragraph-1">I love dogs</p>
<p class="dog-paragraph" id="paragraph-2">I do not love dogs</p>
```

```js
// will select the first paragraph with the class "dog-paragraph"
document.querySelector(".dog-paragraph")

// will select all paragraphs with the class "dog-paragraph"
document.querySelectorAll(".dog-paragraph")

// will select the first paragraph with the id "paragraph-1"
document.querySelector("#paragraph-1")

// will select the only paragraph with the id "paragraph-2" within an array
//  like structure
document.querySelectorAll("#paragraph-2")
```

---

# Exercise

- Create a page with multiple elements, some nested inside of each other, or use a page you've already built

- Practice selecting items and changing their contents from the JavaScript Console

- Once you have the hang of it, write a script to change the content in at least 5 elements
