# Reference Notes

---

# Introduction
- An array is a data structure that can hold multiple values.
- Anything that a variable can hold, an array can also hold.
- Arrays are mostly used to store several types of one thing.
	- e.g. storing a list of filenames

---

# An aside for the end 
- Objects stored in arrays don't need to be the same type, but generally, they will be, since arrays are mostly used to do work on multiple, similar things.

---

# Nested arrays
- Two dimensional arrays are sometimes used to store data that is best represented as a grid.
	- examples: a topographical map
	- a grid showing currents across a body of water
