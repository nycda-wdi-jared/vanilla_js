First day of class for javascript. Beginner material.
Examples of the basics of javascripts,

Create a .js file, and connect it like you would a .css file but with different syntax, and put it on the bottom of your ```<body>```</br>
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/js/file"></script>
```
